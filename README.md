## Usage
```console
./patchmatch [-k] <regex>
```
- `<regex>`: The regular expression pattern, following [RE2 Syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)
- `-k`: An optional flag that, if provided, keeps the changes that match the regex. Everything else is removed.

## Installation
For OSX and Linux, simply run `make install`. This will add the binary to `/usr/local/bin`.  
You can compile it yourself using `make build`.  
Run tests using `make tests`.

## Which changes are removed?
Because splitting changed lines is hard, Patchmatch removes blocks of changes entirely if they match the regular expression.   
Similar to existing visual tools, e.g. VSCodes diff view.  


For example:

```console
foo@bar:~$ git diff | patchmatch "((m|M)odified|(r|R)ewritten|(u|U)pdated)"
```
